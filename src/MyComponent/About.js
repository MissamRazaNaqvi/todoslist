import React from 'react'

export const About = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <h3>This is the About of Todos</h3>
            <p>localIn previous versions of React Router you had to order your routes a certain way to get the right 
                one to render when multiple routes matched an ambiguous URL. V6 is a lot smarter and will pick the most 
                specific match so you don't have to worry about that anymore. For example, the URL /teams/new matches 
                both of these route:
            </p>
        </div>
    )
}
